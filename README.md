## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I would like to learn more about the origins of meteorites that impact Earth. Questions I am curious about include: What is the size distribution of these meteorites? How often do large ones impact Earth? What are the composition of these meteorites? What is the frequency of metal versus stony meteorites? Has any meteorite ever landed in the Okanagan?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My dataset is provided by NASA and The Meteoritical Society.
It contains data on all of the known meteorite landings, about 34,000 of them.
For each meteorite it contains the geolocation, year it fell, mass, and type of meteorite.
The type of meteorite indicates the composition, that is, stony, stony-iron, or iron, and it also indicates the potential origin (e.g. Mars).
