# Group 311 - Meteorite Landing Analysis

## Introduction

I would like to learn more about the origins of meteorites that impact Earth. Questions I am curious about include: What is the size distribution of these meteorites? How often do large ones impact Earth? What are the composition of these meteorites? What is the frequency of metal versus stony meteorites? Has any meteorite ever landed in the Okanagan?

## Dataset - Meteorites

My dataset is provided by NASA and The Meteoritical Society.
It contains data on all of the known meteorite landings, about 34,000 of them.

Columns:
 - Name: Given name, associated with landing site.
 - ID
 - Nametype
     - valid: meteorite has not been weathered
     - relict: meteorite highly weathered
 - recclass: meteorite type
     - Chrondites, Achrondites: Stony
     - Irony
     - PAL: Stony-Iron
 - mass: in grams
 - fall:
     - Found: not seen to fall from sky
     - Fall: seen fall from sky
 - year
 - reclat: Latitude
 - reclong: Longtitude
 - Geolocation: Contains Latitude and Longtitude

This dataset is from NASA's open source archives and was released to benefit science.
This data was collected by human account.
