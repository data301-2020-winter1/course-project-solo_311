# Group 311 - Meteorite Landing Analysis

## Introduction
Video: https://youtu.be/YCOOmkUgxx4

It should have an introduction that gives the reader some information about the data and your question.

For this project, the research is focused on meteorites.

**Definition:** **Meteorite** *(noun)*   A meteor that survives its passage through the earth's atmosphere such that part of it strikes the ground.

Some questions I would like to answer are:
- How are the meteorite landings distributed across the Earth's surface?
    - Have any meteorites been found in the Okanagan?
- What is the mass distribution of these meteorites?
    - What was the largest meteorite ever found?

## Dataset - Meteorites

My dataset is provided by NASA and The Meteoritical Society.
It contains data on all of the known meteorite landings, about 34,000 of them.

Columns:
 - Name: Given name, associated with landing site.
 - ID
 - Nametype
     - valid: meteorite has not been weathered
     - relict: meteorite highly weathered
 - recclass: meteorite type
     - Chrondites, Achrondites: Stony
     - Iron
     - PAL: Stony-Iron
 - mass: in grams
 - fall:
     - Found: not seen to fall from sky
     - Fall: seen fall from sky
 - year
 - reclat: Latitude
 - reclong: Longtitude
 - Geolocation: Contains Latitude and Longtitude

This dataset is from NASA's open source archives and was released to benefit science.
This data was collected by human account.
